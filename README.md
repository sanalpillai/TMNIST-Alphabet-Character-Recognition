# TMNIST Alphabet Character Recognition

## Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at building a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify typographic characters. Utilizing the TMNIST Alphabet dataset, the model is trained to recognize 94 unique characters, providing insights into the effectiveness of CNNs in character recognition tasks.

## Dataset
The [TMNIST Alphabet - 94 Characters](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikbearbrown/tmnist-alphabet-94-characters) dataset from Kaggle serves as the foundation for this project. It is structured similarly to the well-known MNIST dataset but features a broader range of alphabet characters in a 28x28 grayscale image format.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- TensorFlow & Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (via Kaggle Kernels)

## Features
- Development of a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Implementation of data preprocessing techniques, including normalization and one-hot encoding.
- Generation of visualizations to track training and validation accuracy and loss.
- Comprehensive model performance evaluation using a separate test dataset.

## How to Run
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Acquire the TMNIST Alphabet dataset from Kaggle and update the dataset path in the notebook.
3. Execute the Jupyter Notebook in an environment that supports the aforementioned technologies.

## Kaggle Kernel
The notebook is also accessible on Kaggle for an interactive experience: [Character Recognition Insight - TMNIST Exploration](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sanalpillai/character-recognition-insight-tmnist-exploration)
